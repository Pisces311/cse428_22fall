Comments:

Good writeup, if a bit terse.

Nicely structured code overall.

-1 Your Hold 'Em logic needs to be broken up a bit more into smaller functions
so it is more modular, though your Pinochle melds logic is reasonably modular
(organized as cases of a switch statement) even if the function itself is pretty long.

-3 Please avoid using hard coded numbers like 2, 3, and 4 directly in
your code and instead please always use descriptively named const
variables, enum labels, or #define symbols, like you did other places
in the code.

-3 Please make sure to comment all of your source and header files - some had no 
   comments at all.

The code compiled with no errors or warnings, and ran correctly	in my tests, except for:

-1 The usage message appears to have hard coded the name of the binary executable file    // fixed
from the previous lab assignment, rather than using the C-style string that is passed
in the 0th position of argv:

Usage: ./lab1 Pinochle/HoldEm player1 player2 ...

-3 The program did not print out the hand that was made from each player's cards and the
board of common cards.

-3 The program did not correctly order the names of the Hold 'Em players by the relative ranking of the hand that was made with their cards and the common board:

Alice's hand:
2H 10C 
Bob's hand:
9C KS 
Charlie's hand:
6C 9H 
Dawn's hand:
10H 7C 
Erich's hand:
5S 9D 
Fiona's hand:
7H QD 
BOARD(flop): 
8H 9S 7S 

Erich's rank: Pair
Charlie's rank: Pair
Bob's rank: Pair
Fiona's rank: Pair
Dawn's rank: Pair
Alice's rank: X-High

Bob's hand should have been listed first: 9C KS 8H 9S 7S (9s with a king kicker);
Charlie's hand should have been listed next: 6C 9H 8H 9S 7S (9s with 8,7,6 kickers);
Erich's hand should have been listed next: 5S 9D 8H 9S 7S (9s with 8,7,5 kickers);
Fiona's hand should have been listed next: 7H QD 8H 9S 7S (7s with a queen kicker);
Dawn's hand should have been listed next: 10H 7C 8H 9S 7S (7s with a 10 kicker);

-3 The program also did not correctly order the x-high hands:

Alice's hand:
5H 3C 
Bob's hand:
8D JH 
Dawn's hand:
5C QH  
Fiona's hand:
7H 3H 

Bob's rank: X-High
Dawn's rank: X-High
Fiona's rank: X-High
Alice's rank: X-High

Of those, Dawn's hand should have been first, with a queen;
Bob's should have been next, with a jack;
